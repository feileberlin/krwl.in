# FIX SUMMARY (Relocated)

This immediate fix summary has been moved into the main documentation tree to keep the
repository root free of large troubleshooting documents.

Please see `docs/troubleshooting/FIX_SUMMARY.md` for the full details about the default
map filters, event visibility, and the associated diagnostics.

This root-level file is retained only as a short pointer for backwards compatibility and
may be removed in a future cleanup.
