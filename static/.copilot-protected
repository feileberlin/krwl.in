⚠️  COPILOT/AGENT WARNING ⚠️
================================

This directory contains AUTO-GENERATED files that should NOT be edited directly.

🚫 AGENTS MUST NOT:
   - Edit index.html directly (it's auto-generated)
   - Create helper scripts to modify index.html
   - Make changes without going through the generator

✅ TO MAKE CHANGES:
   1. Edit source files:
      - static/css/style.css (app styles)
      - static/js/app.js (app logic)
   2. Run the generator: python3 src/main.py generate
   3. The inliner will fetch Leaflet from CDN and inline everything

📋 FILES THAT ARE SAFE TO EDIT:
   - css/style.css (app styles - SOURCE FILE)
   - js/app.js (app logic - SOURCE FILE)
   - config.json (app configuration data)
   - events.json (event data)
   - pending_events.json (events awaiting review)
   - rejected_events.json (rejected events)
   - content.json / content.de.json (translations)
   - Other non-generated assets

🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY GENERATED FILE:
   - index.html is the ONLY generated file
   - It's regenerated from css/style.css, js/app.js, and CDN resources
   - Event data is injected via update_events_in_html()

⚡ NEW SIMPLIFIED ARCHITECTURE:
   - Single index.html with everything inlined (~66KB)
   - Replaces old generator.py (2185 lines → 300 lines in cdn_inliner.py)
   - css/style.css and js/app.js are now SOURCE files (not generated)
   - Events auto-updated in HTML on approve/publish
