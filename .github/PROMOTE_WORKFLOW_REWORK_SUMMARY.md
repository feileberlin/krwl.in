# Promote Preview Workflow - Complete Rework Summary

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The Promote Preview workflow has been completely reworked to address critical issues and provide a production-ready deployment automation solution. The workflow now handles missing branches gracefully, provides comprehensive validation, and offers an excellent user experience with clear feedback.

## 🚨 Problems Identified & Fixed

### Critical Issues (Previously Broken)

1. **Missing `preview` Branch**
   - **Problem**: Workflow required a `preview` branch that didn't exist in the repository
   - **Impact**: Workflow would fail immediately with unclear error message
   - **Solution**: Added automatic branch creation with user control
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED

2. **Missing Documentation File**
   - **Problem**: `DEPLOYMENT.md` referenced `.github/PROMOTE_WORKFLOW.md` which didn't exist (only in `docs/`)
   - **Impact**: Broken documentation links, confusion for users
   - **Solution**: Created `.github/PROMOTE_WORKFLOW.md` and synced with `docs/`
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### Medium Priority Issues

3. **Outdated GitHub Script Version**
   - **Problem**: Using `actions/github-script@v6` (outdated)
   - **Impact**: Missing features, potential deprecation warnings
   - **Solution**: Updated to `@v7`
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED

4. **No Pre-flight Validation**
   - **Problem**: Workflow didn't validate preconditions before attempting PR creation
   - **Impact**: Confusing errors, failed workflows, wasted CI time
   - **Solution**: Added comprehensive validation step
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### Low Priority Improvements

5. **No Structured Outputs**
   - **Problem**: No machine-readable outputs for downstream workflows
   - **Impact**: Limited automation capabilities
   - **Solution**: Added `pr_number`, `pr_url`, `action_taken` outputs
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED

6. **Poor User Feedback**
   - **Problem**: Minimal feedback in GitHub Actions UI
   - **Impact**: Users had to dig through logs to understand what happened
   - **Solution**: Added workflow summaries with formatted output
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED

## 🆕 New Features

### 1. Automatic Branch Creation

**What**: Creates `preview` branch from `main` if it doesn't exist

**Why**: Enables first-time setup without manual branch creation

**How**: New workflow input `create_preview_if_missing` (default: `true`)

**Example**:
```yaml
- name: 🔍 Validate branches and setup
  # Checks if preview exists
  # If not, creates it from main (if allowed)
  # Provides clear feedback
```

**User Control**:
- Set to `true` (default): Auto-create if missing
- Set to `false`: Fail with clear error if missing

### 2. Comprehensive Pre-flight Validation

**What**: Validates all preconditions before attempting PR creation

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Check `main` branch exists
2. ✅ Check `preview` branch exists (or create it)
3. ✅ Compare branches to detect changes
4. ✅ Skip PR creation if branches are identical
5. ✅ Calculate commits ahead/behind

**Benefits**:
- No wasted CI time on doomed operations
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Better user experience

### 3. Workflow Summaries

**What**: Beautiful formatted summaries in GitHub Actions UI

**Examples**:

When preview branch is created:
```
✓ Preview Branch Created
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The `preview` branch was created from `main`.

📝 Note: Both branches are currently identical.
💡 Next steps: Make changes to the preview branch, test them, then run this workflow again.
```

When PR is created:
```
✓ PR Created
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PR #42 is ready for review.

Commits to merge: 5
→ Review and Merge PR
```

**Benefits**:
- Immediate visual feedback
- No need to dig through logs
- Clear next steps

### 4. Structured Job Outputs

**What**: Machine-readable outputs for automation

**Outputs**:
- `pr_number`: The PR number (if created)
- `pr_url`: Direct link to the PR
- `action_taken`: What the workflow did (created/updated/auto_merged/skipped/etc.)

**Use Case**: Downstream workflows can reference these values

**Example**:
```yaml
jobs:
  promote:
    # ... workflow runs
    
  notify:
    needs: promote
    steps:
      - name: Send notification
        run: |
          echo "PR created: ${{ needs.promote.outputs.pr_url }}"
```

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling

**What**: Clear, actionable error messages

**Examples**:

Before:
```
Error: Reference does not exist
```

After:
```
❌ Head branch 'preview' does not exist
💡 Solution: Set 'create_preview_if_missing' to true to create it automatically.
```

**Benefits**:
- Users know exactly what went wrong
- Users know how to fix it
- Reduced support burden

### 6. Smart Skip Logic

**What**: Automatically skips PR creation when unnecessary

**When**:
- Branches are identical (no changes to promote)
- Preview branch was just created (same as main)

**Behavior**:
- Provides clear summary explaining why PR wasn't created
- Suggests next steps
- Exits successfully (not a failure)

**Benefits**:
- No unnecessary PRs
- Clear communication
- Saves time

## 📊 Workflow Comparison

### Before (Old Workflow)

```yaml
jobs:
  promote:
    steps:
      - checkout
      - create/update PR (might fail if preview doesn't exist)
      - try auto-merge (if requested)
      - console.log output
```

**Issues**:
- ❌ No validation
- ❌ Fails if preview missing
- ❌ Poor error messages
- ❌ Limited feedback
- ❌ No outputs

### After (New Workflow)

```yaml
jobs:
  validate-and-promote:
    outputs:
      pr_number: ...
      pr_url: ...
      action_taken: ...
    steps:
      - checkout (with full history)
      - validate branches
        - check main exists
        - check preview exists
        - create preview if missing (optional)
        - compare branches
        - skip if identical
      - create/update PR (only if changes exist)
        - enhanced PR description
        - commit counts
        - deployment info
      - try auto-merge (if requested)
      - workflow summaries (beautiful formatted output)
```

**Improvements**:
- ✅ Full validation
- ✅ Auto-creates preview
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Rich feedback
- ✅ Structured outputs
- ✅ Smart skip logic

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Workflow Inputs

| Input | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `auto_merge` | choice | `'false'` | Auto-merge PR after creation (only works without branch protection) |
| `create_preview_if_missing` | choice | `'true'` | Create preview branch from main if it doesn't exist |

### Job Outputs

| Output | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `pr_number` | PR number (if created) | `"42"` |
| `pr_url` | Direct PR URL | `"https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42"` |
| `action_taken` | What the workflow did | `"created"`, `"updated"`, `"auto_merged"`, `"skipped_no_changes"` |

### Validation Steps

1. **Check main branch exists**
   - Uses: `github.rest.repos.getBranch()`
   - Fails immediately if missing (critical error)

2. **Check preview branch exists**
   - Uses: `github.rest.repos.getBranch()`
   - If missing and `create_preview_if_missing=true`:
     - Gets main branch SHA
     - Creates preview branch from main
     - Sets output `preview_created=true`
     - Skips PR creation (branches identical)
     - Shows summary with next steps
   - If missing and `create_preview_if_missing=false`:
     - Fails with clear error and solution

3. **Compare branches**
   - Uses: `github.rest.repos.compareCommitsWithBasehead()`
   - Calculates: `commits_ahead`, `commits_behind`
   - Skips PR if `ahead_by == 0 && behind_by == 0`
   - Shows summary if skipping

### PR Creation Logic

```javascript
// Check for existing PRs
const pulls = await github.rest.pulls.list({...});

if (pulls.length > 0) {
  // Update existing PR
  await github.rest.pulls.update({...});
  actionTaken = 'updated';
} else {
  // Create new PR
  const newPr = await github.rest.pulls.create({...});
  actionTaken = 'created';
}

// Set outputs
core.setOutput('pr_number', pr.number);
core.setOutput('pr_url', pr.html_url);
core.setOutput('action_taken', actionTaken);
```

### Auto-merge Logic

```javascript
if (auto_merge === 'true') {
  try {
    await github.rest.pulls.merge({...});
    actionTaken = 'auto_merged';
    // Success summary
  } catch (error) {
    // Blocked summary with reason
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Required

The workflow changes have been implemented and validated syntactically, but require actual GitHub Actions execution to test:

1. **Test: Preview branch doesn't exist**
   - Set: `create_preview_if_missing: true`
   - Expected: Branch created, summary shown, no PR created
   - Verify: Preview branch exists after workflow

2. **Test: Preview branch doesn't exist (strict mode)**
   - Set: `create_preview_if_missing: false`
   - Expected: Workflow fails with clear error message
   - Verify: Error message suggests setting flag to true

3. **Test: Branches are identical**
   - Setup: Preview and main are in sync
   - Expected: Workflow skips PR creation, shows summary
   - Verify: Summary explains why no PR created

4. **Test: Normal PR creation**
   - Setup: Preview has changes
   - Expected: PR created with enhanced description
   - Verify: PR shows commit counts, checklist, deployment info

5. **Test: PR already exists**
   - Setup: Open PR from preview to main
   - Expected: PR updated with new body
   - Verify: PR body refreshed, summary shows "updated"

6. **Test: Auto-merge success**
   - Set: `auto_merge: true`
   - Setup: No branch protection
   - Expected: PR created and merged automatically
   - Verify: PR merged, summary shows success

7. **Test: Auto-merge blocked**
   - Set: `auto_merge: true`
   - Setup: Branch protection enabled
   - Expected: PR created, merge fails gracefully
   - Verify: Summary shows blocked message with reason

### Validation Performed

- ✅ YAML syntax validation (Python yaml module)
- ✅ File structure validation
- ✅ Documentation consistency check
- ✅ Code review of logic flow

### Remaining Validation

   - `auto_merge: false`
   - `create_preview_if_missing: true`

2. Workflow will:
   - Create preview branch from main
   - Show summary explaining next steps
   - Exit successfully

3. Make changes to preview branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout preview
   # make changes
   git push
   ```

4. Run workflow again:
   - Workflow will create PR
   - Review and merge PR
   - Production deploys automatically

### Normal Use

1. Make changes on preview branch
2. Test at `/preview/` path
3. Run workflow (default settings)
4. Review PR in summary
5. Merge PR when ready
6. Production deploys automatically

### Emergency Hotfix

1. Make urgent fix on preview
2. Run workflow with:
   - `auto_merge: true`
   - `create_preview_if_missing: true` (default)
3. If auto-merge succeeds: Done!
4. If auto-merge blocked: Merge PR manually ASAP

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Permissions Required

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write      # To access and create branches
  pull-requests: write # To create/update PRs
  pages: write         # For GitHub Pages deployment
  id-token: write      # For deployment authentication
```

### What the Workflow Can Do

✅ Read repository code
