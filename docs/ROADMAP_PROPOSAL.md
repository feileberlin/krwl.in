## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| Phase 3 features exceed timeline | High | Medium | Mark AI/Federation as optional, defer to later release |
| Test suite slows down CI | Medium | Medium | Optimize tests, use parallel execution |
| Service worker bugs break PWA | Medium | High | Extensive testing, gradual rollout, kill switch |
| OCR accuracy not improved | Medium | Low | Make advanced OCR optional, fallback to Tesseract |
| Moderation dashboard security issues | Low | High | Security audit, penetration testing before launch |

### Contingency Plans

- **If Phase 1 delayed**: Prioritize iCal export and tests, defer PWA to Phase 2
- **If Phase 2 delayed**: Skip RSVP feature, focus on venue registry and moderation
- **If Phase 3 over budget**: Defer AI extraction and ActivityPub to separate project

---

## Communication Plan

### Stakeholder Updates

- **Weekly**: Progress updates in GitHub Discussions
- **Bi-weekly**: Demo of completed features (video or live)
